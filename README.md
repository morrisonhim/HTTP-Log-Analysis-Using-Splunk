# HTTP-Log-Analysis-Using-Splunk
**Project Overview**
- This project demonstrates a practical, hands-on approach to analyzing HTTP web server logs using Splunk. The objective was to ingest a pre-existing Apache access log, extract meaningful fields, identify suspicious or anomalous activity, and generate actionable security insights. The project simulates real-world log analysis scenarios such as detecting brute-force attempts, suspicious HTTP methods, error spikes, and malicious user agents.
